## Unlocking AI Magic: The 7 Essential Building Blocks for the Most Accurate Prompts

These aren't just arbitrary elements, they are a deliberate breakdown for all great prompts. In this guide you'll not only have the opportunity to learn best ways to build prompts, but to see what makes the difference between an average prompt to an excellent one.

These 7 elements include:
1.  **Task: Action-Oriented Commands (MANDATORY!)**

  *   What specific action do you want the AI to do?
      *   Generate
      *   Give
      *   Write
      *   Analyze
      *   Compare
      *   Summarize
      *   Explain
      *   Evaluate

2.  **Context: More Relevant Than Ever (Strategic Gifting of Information)**

  *   **User Background:** Describe your knowledge level/expertise
  *   **Industry or Domain:** Specify niche.
  *   **Expected Goal:** Define desired result

3.  **Exemplars: Learning By Watching!**

   *   What writing or output would be relevant to give AI direction.
   > Here is a paragraph that sounds too technical - I need a marketing report. "The current framework relies on hyper-efficient data transmissions using a 12-bit signal."

4.  **Format: The Way You Need The Information Presented**
  *   Paragraphs (Most Common)
  *   Code Blocks
  *   Markdown
  *   Tables
  *   Emails (If needed, provide headers like: To: Subject: From: )
  *   Lists

5.  **Tone: Emotions and How To Convey Them**
    * Professional
    * Informative
    * Persuasive
    * Helpful

6.  **Structure: Outputting Info in a Structured Way**
    *   What do you need the key outputs to include? The more granular, the better!

7.  **Constraints: Boundaries**
     *   Avoid any language or tones that are too risky for the company
     *   Stay on topic/on brand to promote the company in the best possible light.

**Reminder: Don't Overload the AI - Only Provide Enough Info**

It's easy to think that bombarding the AI with information will lead to a better outcome. But it is best to limit each section and each prompt overall.

## Applying all to AI to Gemini or ChatGPT

Here is an example of all the elements together and working in unison.

You are a Senior Marketing Manager, with ten years of experience and a successful track-record. Your goal is to create a social media strategy that will generate engagement amongst the Gen z population.

You will write this prompt to increase engagement and interest in our new energy drink for gym goers in a social media post.

Example: Here is a current message "If you want to drink and hit the gym our product will help you."

Your output should include an Instagram caption. This must be targeted at Gen Z.
Your caption must only include the following tones:
*   Helpful
*   Persuasive
*   Enthusiastic

Do not say language with any legal risks or negative language.
